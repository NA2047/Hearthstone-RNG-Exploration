            <h3>Where is all the RANDOM</h3>
            <p>
            <h3>Results:</h3>
            After examining the results, I was expecting the chart to show a clear increase in the RNG component of Hearthstone. However, the table does not necessarily indicate this. What we can see is that an expansion like Un’Goro had a more substantial increase than any previous expansion, both in the percentage of the total set as well as by the number of cards. The introduction of the Adapt mechanic can explain a portion of this. Adapt, as a game mechanic, would allow the player to choose from three buffs (selected from a pool of ten) to be applied to your minion(s).
            <br><br>
            This mechanic was used exclusively in the Un’Goro expansion and represented 14 out of the 51 Random cards within Un’Goro.
            If we subtract the 14 Adapt-based cards, we are much closer, but still higher than earlier expansions at 37 random-based cards. We do see an increase in the percentage of RNG-based cards per expansion from 2014 to 2016. Only in 2017 do we begin to see an apparent decrease in the percentage of RNG-based cards compared to expansions earlier in the year. Another factor to examine came in the form of Hearthstone's first expansion rotation. This rotation occurred at the same time when Un’Goro was released.
            <br><br>
            This caused a large number of cards to be retired, moving them out of the “Standard” rotation and into the “Wild” format. The difference between Wild and Standard is the cards permitted to be played. Standard holds only the newest expansions while Wild includes all cards ever made. The removal of cards from Standard to Wild represents Blizzard's desire to replace or supplement some of the RNG based cards that had been removed with this rotation.

            <!-- <h3>Observations:</h3>
            This question tasked me with defining what "Powerful" meant in the context of Hearthstone.<br>
            Due to my experience with Hearthstone, I can intuitively determine whether a card is powerful or not.<br>
            However, providing a way to show powerful cards without needing to have as much background knowledge was<br>
            necessary for readers to understand.
            <br>  <br>
            <h3>  Step 1:</h3>
            I began to codify my intuition into a more programmatic assessment on powerful cards. First,  <br>
            I created the following grading scheme to define and assign Power Level to cards. For each of  <br>
            the criteria below that is satisfied the card is given one point.  <br>
            <br>

          <br> <br>
            <h3>  Results:</h3>
         With the beginning of 2017 and the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, we see a massive spike in power level. <br>
         In later expansions, we see a decline in power level. A possible explanation for this could be that Blizzard <br>
          is trying to refine gameplay rather then increase the power of cards, particularly cards with random effects.  <br>
          These are one of the most challenging cards to balance in the game due to their unpredictability. <br>
 <br> <br>
However, if we look at their RNG factor within the classes and their power level, we can see a trend upwards  <br>
for all classes regarding RNG and power level  <br>

         <!-- <div  class="col span-1-of-1 steps-box"> -->
              <!-- <h3>  Step 3:</h3>
Cards were then separated by their expansion's release date. Each card within each expansion's power level was then filtered by “Adjusted Random” equaling YES and summed to give a Power level of the entire set.
As for classes with the most powerful cards. I again summed the computed “Power Level” fields as a total and set as the rows with the year as the columns. Then, I marked the graph with an area graph colored by classes. Finally, I filtered by “Adjusted Random” equal to YES to get only the random cards and their power levels across each class.

            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <p> For this question, I wanted to give viewers a more enticing visual aesthetic, while allowing users to take in more information at a glance. The motivation behind this decision was to show how RNG cards are distributed across the classes and whether or not any class had more RNG easily.
            <br>  <br> <h3>Step 1:</h3>
               I first started with the Release Date and Expansions positioning them as my columns and then with a count function on Set, as my row.
               <br>  <br><h3>Step 2:</h3>
               I then filtered by “Adjusted Random” equal to YES and my Card Class field to Mark based on color and again a count on Set to change the size of the bars based on the number of RNG cards for that class.
          <br>  <br>  <h3>Results:</h3>
               After examining the results of the graph, we can see that in the later part of the Year cards tend to be more random-based, starting in 2015, increasing in 2016, as well as finally reaching its highest in 2017. We can see that in 2015, and in the later part of 2016 and 2017 class cards with RNG factors start to increase. Again, we can see that Un'Goro is leading the pack with a considerable amount of RNG within each hero class. This still makes sense because the introduction of Un'Goro came at the tail end of a bunch of retiring cards.

            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            This question was one of the easier ones due to the limited number of types within Hearthstone. Types are very similar to modes of transportation such as air, land, and sea. Cards can be one of 4 types: Hero, Weapon, Spell, and Minion, with Minions and Spells being the largest of the 4.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            Here I created a Bubble Map that allows users to see with a simple glance that Minions with RNG are far more common than Spells.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            The bubbles are sized according to the Sum of the power contained within each expansion, of which includes an RNG component. The Color is mapped to the Type of card for easy viewing.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Results:</h3>
            If we look at the number of spells in Hearthstone compared the Number of Minions, Minions outnumber the spells by far. It stands that a reasonable conclusion would be to continue this trend with RNG-based cards.
            This last question didn't harbor any surprises for me. I knew that there were more minions than spells in the game. What I didn't know is if the RNG played a prominent enough role in tipping the RNG factor into the into the Spells' favor.
            However based on the graph Minions with an RNG factor hold a disproportionately large dominance over Spells, with Spells coming second and Weapons and Heroes tailing the pack.

         <div class="row">
            <br><br>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
            I wanted to give users a more interactive way to see the cards. After all, not everyone plays Hearthstone.
            <br>
            I embedded both RNG-based Battlecries and Deathrattles into my site to give the user some freedom to explore. However, these graphs lack discrete values, but this way users can see the cards and get a better feel for the game while still answering the question: which of the two has more interaction with RNG? It seems that Deathrattles have more cards overall than Battlecries. Battlecries give you the benefit right away, however, Deathrattles cards must die before the reward can be used. So, what we see is far more Deathrattles with random effects than Battlecries.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            Images were mapped to shapes which were then used by a "Map Image" filled with card IDs.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            I then put the Rows as the Cost field which corresponded to the Mana cost of each card.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            The size of each card was then marked using Power Level. The larger the card appears to be, the more power it has.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Result:</h3>
            It occurred to me while I was trying to find out which of the two was more common, I also needed to define what common meant in the context of Hearthstone. Eventually, I came to define common as a percentage of the expansion that has Battlecries and or Deathrattles as a mechanic as well as RNG.
            After examining both the Deathrattles and Battlecries, the results are notably evident that Battlecries are much more common to have RNG than Deathrattles are.
            As to why that is, I can only speculate. But, my intuition tells me: knowing that Battlecries are more powerful than Deathrattle in most cases, it is likely that Blizzard wanted to create more powerful cards in general, so they paired RNG components with more Battlecries.

            <h3>A Closer look</h3>
            <p>
               From the graph above we can see that Journey to Un'Goro is the heaviest on RNG. Part of the reason for this is due to that fact that Adapt was introduced in this expansion. These findings would explain why it is so much larger in RNG than other expansions.
               <br>
               <br>
            <h3>Step 1:</h3>
            The process that was used to generate the table was to count the total in each Expansion on the columns,
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 2:</h3>
            Then put the Expansion on the rows to show each expansion
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 3:</h3>
            Filter by Adjusted Random equal to YES with the bard colored by the Expansions and Labeled by year.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Result:</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            As for the last question, it is no surprise that the expansion with the most RNG is Journey to Un'Goro. As I stated before, the Adapt mechanic was introduced in this expansion exclusively. Un'Goro also came at a time when a lot of cards were retired, meaning that this set had to be much stronger to replenish the older powerful cards being retired. The same can be said for the RNG cards as well. Un'Goro, it seems, is a bridging expansion helping to alleviate some of the loss from the previous expansions while simultaneously rekindling some new and exciting cards for future expansions.
